# About the project

**Jokenpo**, as the name suggests, is a website for playing **Rock, Paper, Scissors**.
You choose one of the three possible hands by clicking the respective button, while the site’s computer makes a random choice. Then, the winner is announced, clearly showing what each player threw.
<br>
The site **only supports Brazilian Portuguese**, but it is very **intuitive**, even for those who don’t understand the language, as the game logic is visually explained using **ARIA features**.
